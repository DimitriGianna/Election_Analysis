## Challenge Overview and Summary
The script used to obtain the above results can be modified  to be used in any election. For example, the modification shown below was used in this analysis to determine the number of votes per county using the same format as the number of votes per candidate. Similarly, a modificatation could be made that would work in a federal or municipal election, in which case we would change the counties to states or ridings respectively.
